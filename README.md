Fun with the PICOEMP - Mediocre Reverser
This Repo will be about how I built and ran the picoemp at home for under 60$. For a proof of concept and to ball on a budget I highly recommend this option for all electrical engineers before investing into BADFET or the CHIPSHOUTER/CHIPWHISPERER. This great alternative took me around 3 days total and was a hell of a lot of fun to build. My friends who build them alongside me would agree that it was a super cool project and the end product was well worth it to build. 
# PCB and Parts
The PICOEMP was designed by world renound engineer Colin O Flynn/NewAE. It was built as a cheap alternative for the chip shouter and for engineers looking to put an EMP/EMFI into a chip. BTW this is so fkn cool. Also Colin big shoutout to you and thank you for doing this <3. 
To order the PICOEMP PCP you have to pull down the gerber files from https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp/tree/main/hardware/gerbers/rev04_normal]. Download all of the gerber files then zip them all into a zip folder. For example on linux:
